CAVIAR Test Case Scenarios

Video clips created July 11, 2003 and January 20, 2004

For the CAVIAR project a number of video clips were recorded acting out the different scenarios of interest. These include people walking alone, meeting with others, window shopping, entering and exitting shops, fighting and passing out and last, but not least, leaving a package in a public place.

The first section of video clips were filmed for the CAVIAR project with a wide angle camera lens in the entrance lobby of the INRIA Labs at Grenoble, France. The resolution is half-resolution PAL standard (384 x 288 pixels, 25 frames per second) and compressed using MPEG2. The file sizes are mostly between 6 and 12 MB, a few up to 21 MB.
