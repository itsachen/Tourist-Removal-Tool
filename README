Tourist Removal Tool is a program originally developed for
CS2110(OOP and Data Structures).

From the GUI you select a directory that contains images
with the filename formatted like fname_num.jpg.

The program sorts these images into a video, then creates a summarized image
from the series of images.

Therein lies the "tourist removal" aspect of the program. The program
analyzes the median value of all the pixels of all the images and constructs
the median image from this process.

You could have a series of images depicting a landmark and a person walking
through the scene. With this program you can remove the person and have that
final picture with the landmark.

Sample pictures within directories are included.

The main in Display starts the GUI.
